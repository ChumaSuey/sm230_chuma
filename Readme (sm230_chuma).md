### General Information / Behind the scenes.

To make a quick and doable idea, i decided to make a sequel of some sorts to Thundervarium from previous speedmapping sm227… the idea of the player vs the shamblers with just the LG it’s something really unique to feel and play, even more with the soft powerups, the map has a lot of items with respawn to avoid any possible softlock and enjoy what the map is, a fully action shambler rampage.

Initially i used a vanilla red sky, as this map is basically a sequel of SM227 i decided to ask Yuyi and Alunadrern for both values like the old times, the vanilla red sky became blue and i went back and used the same modified sky with both moons like back in the day.

All the poetry in the map (the trigger texts) was written by me.

The music was a bit more of a trivia : Debating myself due to time constraint whether or not i should make a song, i made one in FL Studio in 2 hours and 30 minutes ( 3 hours max), i only used a pad and a lead bass, the drums were added later, but i had the drum sequence in my mind for weeks before making it, eventually the song got a second version with a bit more of kick drums and a volume adjustment in the end being a bit more subtle.

### Special thanks
